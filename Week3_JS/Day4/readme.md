Day 4 - Functions — JS Practice

This file explains functions in JavaScript step by step, where each concept builds on the previous one.

It starts with a **basic function** that prints a fixed greeting. Since that is not flexible, a **parameter** is added so the function can greet anyone by name. After that, a **return value** is introduced so the function gives back a result instead of just printing. That returned value is stored in a variable and used further. Building on that, a function with **multiple parameters** returns a full sentence about a student. Then the same idea is written as a **function expression**, where a function is stored inside a variable. Finally, the same is rewritten as an **arrow function**, showing the shortest and cleanest way to write a function in JavaScript.
