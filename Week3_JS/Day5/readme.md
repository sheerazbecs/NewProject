Day 5 - Practice Problems — JS

This file combines everything from Day 1 to Day 4 using an Employee & Salary theme.

It stores employee details using **variables** and prints them with a template literal. A **condition** checks if the employee qualifies for a senior role. Another condition uses **else if** to assign a salary level as Entry, Mid, Senior, or Executive. A **for loop** labels each work hour as normal or overtime. A **for...of loop** prints each department from an array. A **function** returns an introduction sentence, and another function takes a salary and returns the level. Finally, an array of employee objects is looped through and the salary function is called for each one to print the full result.
