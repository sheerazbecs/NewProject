Day 3 - Loops — JS Practice

This file covers the different types of loops in JavaScript.

A **for loop** counts from 1 to 5 and prints each number. A **while loop** does the same but checks the condition before each step. A **for...of loop** goes through an array of fruits and prints each one. A **for...in loop** goes through an object and prints each key with its value. Finally, a **for loop combined with if** is used to print only even numbers from 1 to 10.
