Day 1 - Variables & Data Types — JS Practice

This file covers the basic data types in JavaScript.

It uses **String** to store a first and last name, **Number** for age and GPA, and **Boolean** to check if the person is a student. **Undefined** is shown with a variable that has no value yet, and **Null** represents an intentionally empty value. An **Object** stores related data like name and city together, an **Array** holds a list of favorite colors, and a **Function** returns a simple greeting message.
