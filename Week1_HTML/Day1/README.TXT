1. What is HTML?
    HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. 
It is the standard language used to create web pages. 
Think of HTML as the skeleton or building blocks of a website. 
Every webpage you visit on the internet uses HTML to structure its content.

Key Points:
HTML is not a programming language
It is a markup language that structures web content
HTML files have the extension .html
Web browsers (like Chrome, Firefox) read HTML files and display them as web pages

2. HTML Tags
    HTML tags are the basic units of HTML. 
They are special codes that tell the web browser how to display the content.

Characteristics of Tags:
Tags are written between angle brackets < >
Most tags come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag
The closing tag has a forward slash (/) before the tag name
Tags are like containers that hold content

2. HTML Elements
An HTML element is everything from the opening tag to the closing tag, including the content in between.

Parts of an HTML Element:
Opening Tag - Starts the element
Content - The actual text or media
Closing Tag - Ends the element

Example and its breakdown:
example: <h1>Hello World, First Task</h1>
breakdown:
<h1> = Opening tag
Hello World, First Task = is Content
</h1> = Closing tag
The entire line (opening tag + content + closing tag) is called an HTML element
