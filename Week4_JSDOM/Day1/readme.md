DOM Introduction

This introduces the concept of DOM (Document Object Model). A simple webpage displays student information like name, age, and course inside HTML elements. When the user clicks the "Access DOM" button, JavaScript uses document.getElementById() to read those elements and show them in the output box — demonstrating how the browser converts HTML into objects that JavaScript can access.
