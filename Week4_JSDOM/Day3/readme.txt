DOM Events

This project demonstrates how events work in JavaScript DOM. 
The webpage has two sections — a click event and a submit event. 
When the user clicks the "Click Me" button, JavaScript listens for the click 
using `addEventListener` and displays a message. In the submit section, the 
user enters their name and clicks "Submit" — if the field is empty it shows a 
red error message, and if filled it shows a green welcome message — 
demonstrating how real-world form validation works using DOM events.
